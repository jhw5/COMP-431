I thought that the presentation about the css frameworks was most polished and delivered. 
Even though it did not have fancy graphics, the font was readable (not too small) and 
the slides were succinct and too the point. The presentation flow in general was easy to follow.

I thought that I learned a lot from the Hybrid Mobile Apps presentation. Most notably, 
I learned about how Cordova offers a variety of plugins for easy implementation and that
updates for native apps (ios or andriod) render previously developed apps useless.

I am glad someone talked about the Materials Design Lite. I looked into the API and it looks super cool! I might even
implement the library in my front end for my project! Just because Material Design Lite is such a cool library,
I liked this talk the most.
