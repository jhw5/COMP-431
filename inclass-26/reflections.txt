great crash course to web development
love that it covers everything from front end to back end
scope of the material is broad but gives a great introduction to web development

would prefer if the project was split into smaller pieces
	eg: front end is broken into two parts rather than submitting front end all at once 

Personally, I zone out at most lecture classes, so it was more helpful when I asked you questions outside class time

TA's can be more helpful, inclass assignments are tough and it can be difficult to ask you questions when everyone is lining up to ask you questions

Great class overall :D
