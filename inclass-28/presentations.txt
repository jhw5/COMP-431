I thought that the presentation about Advertising was most polished. I liked the graphics/pictures that he used 
and the minimal text that complements each photo. The consistent design theme is simple and easy to follow. 
To elaborate, the headers are consistently in a blue region at the top of each slide, and each photo is constently
complimented by text beside it. 

I thought that I learned the most from the Web Crawler presentation. Thought it was interesting how he mentioned 
legal issues surrounding big data scraping. I also loved how he mentioned Quora as an example of how we would manually
scrape the data. He also touched upon the web crawling framework, scrapy, to parse html web pages. 

I liked the web crawler presentation the most because I found the topic most interesting. It gave me an introduction
to web scraping and the tools that I should look into like scrapy.
